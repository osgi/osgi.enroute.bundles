base.version: 1.0.0
Bundle-Name: OSGi enRoute Gogo Shell
Bundle-Description: \
	An adaption of the famous Apache Felix Gogo shell that uses JLine to provide command \
	history and line editing features. Since the Eclipse terminal does not support \
	line editing, it works there as usual.\
	It was adapted by Neil Bartlett.
